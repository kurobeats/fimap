Welcome to the fimap project!
=============================

fimap is a little python tool which can find, prepare, audit, exploit and even google automatically for local and remote file inclusion bugs in webapps. fimap should be something like [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.sourceforge.net) just for LFI/RFI bugs instead of sql injection.

Originally, this tool was created by [this very awesome fellow](https://tha-imax.de/git/root/fimap/tree/master) but there hasn't been a lot of movement on the project since porting to github.

## What works currently?

*   Check a Single URL, List of URLs, or Google results fully automatically.
*   Can identify and exploit file inclusion bugs.

*   Relative\Absolute Path Handling.
*   Tries automatically to eliminate suffixes with Nullbyte and other methods like Dot-Truncation.
*   Remotefile Injection.
*   Logfile Injection.

*   Test and exploit multiple bugs:

*   include()
*   include_once()
*   require()
*   require_once()

*   You always define absolute pathnames in the configs. No monkey like redundant paths like:

*   ../etc/passwd
*   ../../etc/passwd
*   ../../../etc/passwd

*   Has a Blind Mode (--enable-blind) for cases when the server has disabled error messages.
*   Has an interactive exploit mode which...

*   ...can spawn a shell on vulnerable systems.
*   ...can spawn a reverse shell on vulnerable systems.
*   ...can do everything you have added in your_payload-dict_ inside the_config.py_

*   Add your own payloads and paths to the config.py file.
*   Has a Harvest mode which can collect URLs from a given domain for later pentesting.
*   Works also on windows.
*   Can handle directories in RFI mode like:

*   <tt><? include ($_GET["inc"] . "/content/index.html"); ?></tt>
*   <tt><? include ($_GET["inc"] . "_lang/index.html"); ?></tt>
*   where Null-Byte is not possible.

*   Can use proxies.
*   Scans and exploits GET, POST and Cookies.
*   Has a very small footprint. (No senseless paths bruteforces - unless you need it.)
*   Can attack also windows servers! 
*   Has a tiny plugin interface for writing exploitmode plugins 

*   Non Interactive Exploiting

## What doesn't work yet?

*   Other languages than PHP (even if engine is ready for others as well.)

## Is there a How To?

*   Check out [this](http://kaoticcreations.blogspot.com/2011/08/automated-lfirfi-scanning-exploiting.html) post by HR from [Kaotic Creations](http://kaoticcreations.blogspot.com) which explains fimap really good :) It's a tutorial for windows but I think unix heads should understand it as well.
