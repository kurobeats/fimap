fimap v.09_svn
:: Automatic LFI/RFI scanner and exploiter
:: by Iman Karim (fimap.dev@gmail.com)

Usage: ./fimap.py [options]
## Operating Modes:
   -s , --single                 Mode to scan a single URL for FI errors.
                                 Needs URL (-u). This mode is the default.
   -m , --mass                   Mode for mass scanning. Will check every URL
                                 from a given list (-l) for FI errors.
   -g , --google                 Mode to use Google to aquire URLs.
                                 Needs a query (-q) as google search query.
   -H , --harvest                Mode to harvest a URL recursivly for new URLs.
                                 Needs a root url (-u) to start crawling there.
                                 Also needs (-w) to write a URL list for mass mode.
## Techniques:
   -b , --enable-blind           Enables blind FI-Bug testing when no error messages are printed.
                                 Note that this mode will cause lots of requests compared to the
                                 default method. Can be used with -s, -m or -g.
   -D , --dot-truncation         Enables dot truncation technique to get rid of the suffix if
                                 the default mode (nullbyte poison) failed. This mode can cause
                                 tons of requests depending how you configure it.
                                 By default this mode only tests windows servers.
                                 Can be used with -s, -m or -g. Experimental.
   -M , --multiply-term=X        Multiply terminal symbols like '.' and '/' in the path by X.

                                 request to google. fimap will count the time between two requests

   -w , --write=LIST             The LIST which will be written if you have choosen
                                 harvest mode (-H). This file will be opened in APPEND mode.
   -d , --depth=CRAWLDEPTH       The CRAWLDEPTH (recurse level) you want to crawl your target site
                                 in harvest mode (-H). Default is 1.
   -P , --post=POSTDATA          The POSTDATA you want to send. All variables inside

                                 the target language in blind-mode. In that case you will get some
                                 options you can choose if fimap isn't sure which lang it is.

        --dot-trunc-also-unix    Use this if dot-truncation should also be tested on unix servers.
## Attack Kit:
   -x , --exploit                Starts an interactive session where you can
                                 select a target and do some action.
   -T , --tab-complete           Enables TAB-Completation in exploit mode. Needs readline module.
                                 Use this if you want to be able to tab-complete thru remote
                                 files\dirs. Eats an extra request for every 'cd' command.
## Disguise Kit:
   -A , --user-agent=UA          The User-Agent which should be sent.
        --http-proxy=PROXY       Setup your proxy with this option. But read this facts:
                                   * The googlescanner will ignore the proxy to get the URLs,
                                     but the pentest\attack itself will go thru proxy.
                                   * PROXY should be in format like this: 127.0.0.1:8080
                                   * It's experimental
        --show-my-ip             Shows your internet IP, current country and user-agent.
                                 Useful if you want to test your vpn\proxy config.

   -I , --install-plugins        Shows some official exploit-mode plugins you can install 
                                 and\or upgrade.

## Examples:
  1. Scan a single URL for FI errors:

  2. Scan a list of URLS for FI errors:
        ./fimap.py -m -l '/tmp/urllist.txt'
  3. Scan Google search results for FI errors:
